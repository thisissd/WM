/*
Defining current week : Explanation
DATEPART(weekday, GETDATE()) returns the current day of the week as an integer (for example, if today is Tuesday, returns 2)
DATEADD(day, 1-DATEPART(weekday, GETDATE()), CONVERT(date, GETDATE())) adds 1-DATEPART(weekday, GETDATE()) many days to current date (for example, if today is Tuesday, it adds -1 days and sets the date to this week's Monday)
DATEADD(day, 8-DATEPART(weekday, GETDATE()), CONVERT(date, GETDATE())) adds 8-DATEPART(weekday, GETDATE()) many days to current date (for example, if today is Tuesday, it adds 6 days and sets the date to next week's Monday)
